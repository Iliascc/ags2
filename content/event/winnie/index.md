## Mrs. Winnie Madikizela Mandela Funeral (2018)

On the 1st of April 2018, Mr. Nate, one of the filming crew members and myself arranged a meeting at Lakeside Mall Wimpy for us to discuss the filming of a documentary of myself and Mrs. Winne Mandela about the importance of our contribution to the freedom and democracy. We sat and discussed the meeting for shooting the documentary for that week but to our astonishment she passed away the next day on the 2nd of April 2018. Being shocked to have heard the news on radio and TV of her sad passing which was a great loss. We in South Africa have lost the most important and iconic figure of one of the greatest legends that played a role for our freedom. The untold story and proof of Ma Winnie and the Indian of Soweto during 1978, has deprived South Africa and the world of the events that transpired in Soweto because of her untimely death. We tried on numerous occasions to get the interview with Ma Winnie but everytime we did, she was either abroad or occupied with meetings or sickly.

That last week before her death, she was prepared to have met with me after 40 years to share some of those stories of our meetings and plans. I could not live being an Indian in Soweto or having a bank account without the protection of the secrecy that surrounded my involvement with the ANC and MK. Ma Winnie during the mid-70’s, did not live in Soweto because she had to consider her safety by moving around unnoticed. During one of our meetings, she mentioned to me that if anything happened to her, I had to contact Mrs. Fatima Meer. Mrs. Meer was an Indian lady who was associated with Mr. Nelson Mandela during the 70’s. After 1994, it was impossible to get in contact with Ma Winnie, therefore I moved forward. In 2015, after 37 years we met in Vilakazi Street for the annual Mandela Day event and we exchanged some of our secretive experiences in laughter. When I 1st heard of her passing, I immediately went to her house to pay my last respects for her soul to rest in peace.
