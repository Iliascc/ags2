## Early Life

I was born on the 20th of April 1957 in Umlazi hospital in Durban, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. During this time, the population of the Indians was around 650 000. My mother was a housewife. My father was a cobbler at Welco Shoe Factory in Mobeni. I came from a family of 7 siblings, 2 brothers and 4 sisters and I am the 5th child. My father died when I was 8 years old in 1965. 

My oldest sister was the 1st female to work at Welco Shoe Factory at the age of 15 following my father’s passing to support our family. I have fond memories of the area I grew up in Reunion, opposite the then Louis Botha Airport. I went to Reunion Primary School for my early education. I was 6 years old when we were taught the Afrikaans language, which was being introduced in our schools at the time. The 1st Indian who had taught me Afrikaans in school was Mr. Francis Vurdiah, who was also my father’s colleague at the shoe factory. 

When I had finished primary school, I attended secondary school which was about 8 km from our house by foot. When my father died of brain haemorrhage, it was very difficult for my mother to support and send us to school with no financial assistance. She would earn a living washing clothes for people to put a plate of food on the table for us. It was a memorable period of my life because in those days it was not common for women to be employed. While my mother would be occupied with work, my 2nd eldest sister, Radha Soobiah used to take care of us at the young age of 10 years.
