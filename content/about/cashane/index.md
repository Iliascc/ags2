## The Birth Of Cashane (1986)

In 1986, Cashane Kurosha Soobiah was born on the 13th Of January. The name Cashane was got from a hotel that
was named Cashane Hotel in Rustenburg in The North West Province Of South Africa. I the father, who was passing
by Rustenburg, fell inlove with the name Cashane, told my wife who was pregnant at that time, told her if the
child would be a girl, she would be named Cashane. She was born in Durban. I lived with my wife and my daughter
Cashane in Laudium till we divorced in 1988. She later moved to Durban with her mother. 
The name Cashane symbolises an acronym that was given her uncle Jay Govender.

C - Courageous

A - Ambitious

S - Successful

H - Humorous

A - Adventurous

N - Naughty

E - Entertaining

Cashane was a very religious and Godly child from the time of her birth. She worshipped her god Ganesha, whom she was inlove with. She was a very loveable and respected child amongst her family, friends and colleagues. She later completed her Bachelor Of Arts in Political Science and Sociology on the 16th of April 2009 in the University Of Kwazulu-Natal. Cashane never made it to fulfil her dreams by creating a society and a nation free from the suffering of HIV & Aids. She sadly passed away in a car accident in Durban, Kwazulu-Natal on the 24 of July in 2009. During my days of mourning for my daughter Cashane Soobiah, I was humbled and grateful for the letter of condolences I received for the loss of my child from two of the greatest living intellectuals in the research medical field from Thomas J. Coates Ph.D. & Anke A. Ehrardt, Ph.D., sent to my ex-wife and the Soobiah family.
